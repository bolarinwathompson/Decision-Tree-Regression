# Decision Tree Regression for ABC Grocery

## Project Overview:
The **ABC Grocery Decision Tree Regression** project uses **Decision Trees** to predict the target variable based on customer transaction and demographic data. The model helps ABC Grocery understand how different features, such as transaction history, customer demographics, and other variables, influence customer behavior. This prediction model can assist in inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement strategies.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to use **Decision Tree Regressor** to predict customer behavior (e.g., **sales prediction** or **loyalty score**) based on historical transaction and customer data. The project aims to assess which features most affect the target variable, improve predictive accuracy, and provide actionable insights for ABC Grocery.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The project handles data cleaning, feature selection, and outlier removal to ensure that the decision tree algorithm operates efficiently.
- **Model Training**: The **Decision Tree Regressor** is used to predict the target variable based on customer data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: We use **cross-validation** to identify the optimal model parameters, such as **maximum depth** and **minimum samples per leaf**.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using **R² score** and **mean squared error (MSE)** to assess prediction accuracy.

## Methods & Techniques:

### **1. Data Preprocessing**:
The raw customer data is preprocessed to remove unnecessary columns and handle missing values. The data is split into **features (X)** and the **target variable (y)**. Categorical features are encoded using **One-Hot Encoding** to convert them into numerical values.

### **2. Decision Tree Regression**:
We apply a **Decision Tree Regressor** to model the relationship between the features and the target variable. The model splits the data into branches based on different feature values to minimize the error in predictions at each decision node:
- **Maximum Depth**: The maximum depth of the tree is adjusted to prevent overfitting.
- **Minimum Samples Leaf**: Minimum samples per leaf are defined to control tree complexity and prevent overfitting.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using **train-test split** with cross-validation to ensure robustness.

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**:
- The optimal **maximum depth** of the decision tree is determined using cross-validation. The goal is to find the tree depth that minimizes overfitting while maximizing accuracy.
- The **mean squared error (MSE)** is used to measure the performance of the model.

### **4. Model Evaluation**:
The **R² score** is calculated for both training and test datasets to assess how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model fits the data.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used to quantify the accuracy of predictions, with lower values indicating better performance.

### **5. Visualization**:
The trained decision tree model is visualized to understand its structure and the decision-making process. The tree is plotted with **feature names** and **target variables** to provide an intuitive understanding of how the model makes predictions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language for data processing, model implementation, and evaluation.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing the **Decision Tree Regressor**, **train-test split**, **cross-validation**, and **R² score**.
- **pandas**: For handling and manipulating the customer and transaction data.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing the decision tree model.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model for future use.

## Key Results & Outcomes:
- The **Decision Tree Regressor** successfully models the relationship between customer data and the target variable.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** helped optimize the tree’s depth and prevent overfitting, improving prediction accuracy.
- The **R² score** and **MSE** metrics provide a clear measure of the model's performance, showing how well the model predicts the target variable.

## Lessons Learned:
- **Feature selection** and proper **data preprocessing** are essential to improve model performance and interpretability.
- **Cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** are crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well on unseen data.
- Visualizing the **decision tree** is a powerful way to interpret the model's predictions and understand the decision-making process.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** for more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Explore ensemble techniques like **Random Forest** or **Gra**
